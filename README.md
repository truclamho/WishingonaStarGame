Wishing on a Star

Wishing on a Star is a mini-web game I had developed. The premise of the game is to control
the playable character using the joystick/arrow keys to catch falling stars while avoiding
meteors. Check my folders for more in-depth information such as game outline, descriptions, 
game images, game video, and more.
